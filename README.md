### Daily Meetings 
- Stand Up 10 mins maximum
  - What was done previous work day
  - What will be worked on today
  - Any blockers. 
  - Setup followup meetings for anything that can not be immediate resolved in 2 mins.

  - set a fixed time try to complete at least 1 ticket each session its better if you can do more.
