A simple crud application for recording and claiming rewards granted to students for class participation and other positive actions..

## Proposed User Stories

- As a TA I a from to record a students good participation in class, slack and discord so that I can keep track of rewards they earned

- As a student I want an account to log into the participation tool and manage my rewards

- As a student I a form to choose my reward and for which assignment it applies so that can easily communicate this to the instructional team

- As a TA I want to be a to mark a students reward claim as done so that we can keep track of remaining rewards

- As a student I want the option to donate my reward to another student in my course

- As an instructor I a button for volunteering a random student for a task each day which excludes students who already participated today.

## Software Development Life Cycle

The team will learn and apply Agile Software Development practices. 
Work will be undertaken in weekly units known as "Sprints". 
Deliverables are due each Thursday to be demoed infront of the stakeholder "as is" for his feedback in a "Review" session. 
The phases of a sprint will be as follows:

- Sprint Planning
- Start of Sprint
- Daily Standups
- Daily Backlog Grooming
- End of Sprint
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Retro



### Regular Meetings 
- Sprint Planning
  - Decide which subset of the 'Ready' ticket will be in the work queue for the upcoming week. The work queue for the upcoming sprint is called the "Sprint Backlog"
    - Pay attention to how many points are in a sprint
    - Pay attention to how many points are assigned to an individual
    - Keep in mind there is no separate point allocation for testing but the difficulty can vary
- Stand Up 10 mins maximum, daily at 10:30am
  - What was done previous work day
  - What will be worked on today
  - Any blockers. 
  - Setup followup meetings for anything that can not be immediate resolved in 2 mins.
- Backlog Grooming
  - Each day the development team will meet to discuss ticket to add more detail to each ticket to make ot super clear, i mean fool-proof.
  - set a fixed time try to complete at least 1 ticket each session its better if you can do more.
- Sprint Review
  - Demo the product and its new feature to the stakeholder
  - Record feeback and discuss in the upcoming session incase this feedback affects the backlog
- Sprint Retro
  -   Dev team only meeting (no stinky stakeholder present)
  -   Discuss what went well during the sprint weeek
  -   What did not go well and what needs to change to avoid this recurring.

  - The code is completed and working correctly 
  - The code is documented
